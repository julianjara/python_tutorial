On 28 March 1944, the people in hiding in the Secret Annex 
heard an appeal on the radio from Dutch minister Bolkestein, 
who had fled to London because of the war. 
He asked the Dutch to hang on to important documents, 
so that it would be clear after the war what they all 
had experienced during the German occupation.
